# Cryptocurrency Data Scraper
This data scraper is a tool which can collect historical cryoptocurrency data for a given date/time range and sampling frequency.

Note: This project is very much a work in progress. While the core functionality has been developed, I have yet to integrate everything together. Updates are coming soon.

This tool scrapes a website which does have it's own [terms of service](https://coincodex.com/page/terms-of-service/). By using this tool you are accessing the site, so please adhere to their policies.
